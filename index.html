		<h3>Look no further!</h3>
		<p class="my-class">Black cats are the least likely type of cat to be adopted - just for their colour alone. They are associated with bad luck, Halloween, and overall considered "boring" compared to other breeds out there. Many of these cats will spend their life in shelters or foster homes without ever finding their forever homes.</p>
		<p>It is my assumption and hope that you are here because you have adopted a black cat, yay! This website will help you narrow down the name you would like to give your fluffy friend, so take a look through our lists, and choose wisely!</p>
		<p>You can choose from 3 categories: Traditional, Pop Culture, or Food! Let's get started!</p>
